  Our family began a transformative journey with our youngest son Eddy's autism diagnosis, 
  one of our three children on the spectrum. This personal experience connected us to the 
  challenges families facing autism. We felt compelled to make a difference, inspired by 
  our own journey and the loss of our four parents, including the beloved family member after whom
  our center is named, Ed Anser.
founders_hidden_text: >-
  We founded The Ed Asner Family Center (TEAFC) to provide a sanctuary for 
  families like ours. Our center symbolizes the resilience and unity of our family, often called 
  the "Brady Bunch of Autism." It stands as a testament to the strength that love and solidarity 
  bring in navigating autism. At TEAFC, we've created a community of empathy, understanding, and 
  inclusivity. Our programs, including camps, support groups, enrichment activities, and unique 
  adult initiatives like THE DATING Spectrum, meet the varied needs of the autistic community and 
  their families. Our commitment is deeply rooted in personal experience, and our vision is to 
  create a world where everyone is embraced and valued for their unique abilities.
