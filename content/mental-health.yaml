      This program is designed to help all family members, including grandparents or caregivers. The family will learn how to comfortably express their feelings, 
      find better ways to communicate with each other, to solve problems effectively, identify and understand neurodivergence and to better address struggles in the 
      home, school, workplace or out in the community.  While defining clear goals and ways to support those goals, clinicians work closely with all family members. 
      Sessions are focused on teaching the skills necessary to encourage the family as a whole to be better communicators and focus on a healthier way of living and
      a higher quality of life for the entire family.

      Focus is placed on supporting the caregiver. Caregivers often feel overwhelmed, overextended, or alone. Oftentimes this is a step parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle or 
      extended family member who is unsure how to handle the intense behaviors, sensory difficulties or emotional issues that accompany caring for a neurodivergent child or adult. 
      The caregiver is supported during private one-on-one counseling sessions. By getting the support you need, depression or anxiety can be reduced and replaced by understanding 
      and self-care.

    info_card_paragraph: >-
      We are taking a unique approach in working with siblings through a creative avenue. Sessions are run by a therapist along with one of our art teachers. This program offers 
      support for the sibling of a neurodivergent child/adult.  Often the sibling wonders why everything is focused on their brother or sister and not on them. They might feel 
      that they don't get enough time to do the things they want to do. Siblings may feel guilt or anger towards their brother or sister for always being the center of the 
      parent's attention. The participant will be able to express feelings through games and activities.
