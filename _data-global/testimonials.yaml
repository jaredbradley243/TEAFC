  TEAFC is unlike any program I've been part of; it's unique. The staff really supports each of 
  us in a special way, showing they want to connect and genuinely support me. Working at the 
  Funko museum has been incredible, teaching me independence and helping me aim for my first job.

  TEAFC is like a second home where I'm warmly supported and can meet 
  new friends. I don't have to worry about problems here. Art class has improved my skills, 
  and music has let me create original songs. Learning K-pop and break dancing in dance class 
  has been so much fun. It's a place where I feel truly comfortable and supported.

  Since the academy's beginning, I've been part of TEAFC. Jacqi's animation class has been a 
  step towards my dream of making my own movies. With acting in my family, Max's improv and 
  Scott's voice acting classes have sharpened my skills. I cherish making new friends, reuniting 
  with old ones, and the invaluable life skills learned through unique opportunities like working 
  at the Funko museum.
