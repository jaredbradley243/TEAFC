event_1_text: "At The Academy, we believe that hands-on experience in real-world workplace settings is crucial for our participants. To facilitate this, The Ed Asner Family Center collaborates with local corporations to provide internship opportunities for our participants. These internships offer valuable insights into different aspects of working in a corporate environment, encompassing corporate culture and other significant elements of the rofessional world. For 2024, we are thrilled to announce Funko as our partnering organization, and we take immense pride in this collaboration."
